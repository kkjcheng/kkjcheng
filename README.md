I'm the founder of [Decoda Health](https://decodahealth.com), where I'm building the operating system for modern healthcare practices.

Decoda is a full-stack platform that handles everything a healthcare practice needs to run — scheduling, patient communication, billing, forms, inventory, and more. We've built AI assistants that can handle phone calls, answer patient questions, and automate the tedious parts of running a practice so providers can focus on care.

The platform is multi-tenant from the ground up, serving practices of all sizes with isolated data and custom branding. Under the hood, it's a FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL, a Next.js frontend, and integrations with just about everything — payment processors, insurance verification, voice/SMS providers, and the major AI APIs.
